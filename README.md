**MacIsland** brings the **Dynamic Island experience to macOS**, inspired by iOS.
It’s a sleek, interactive floating UI that integrates system essentials like **AirDrop, temporary file storage, and battery insights**, with now-playing music and playback controls, and upcoming support for notifications.

> ℹ️ **Note:** MacIsland is under active development — expect frequent updates. See the [latest release](https://github.com/BadRat-in/MacIsland/releases/latest) for what's new.

## ✨ Features

- [x] **Drag & Drop for AirDrop** – Easily drag and drop files to share via AirDrop.
- [x] **DropTray (Temporary Storage)** – Drop files into a tray that stores them for **1 day (default)**, with customizable duration.
- [x] **Battery Status** – Instantly check your Mac’s battery percentage in the island.
- [x] **Now Playing Display** – Track title, artist, album, artwork, and remaining time, with an auto-popup chip when the track changes. _See limitations below._
- [x] **Music Controls** – Play, pause, skip, and scrub the current track from the now-playing panel.
- [x] **System Volume** – Drag-to-set output volume from the panel; tracks external changes (volume keys, Sound settings).

> **Now Playing limitation.** macOS does not expose a public, system-wide "what's playing now" API to native AppKit apps — `MPMusicPlayerController` and `MusicKit.SystemMusicPlayer` are both `@available(macos, unavailable)`, and Apple's private `MediaRemote.framework` now returns "Operation not permitted" on macOS 15+. As a workaround MacIsland listens to the public `DistributedNotificationCenter` broadcasts from **Music.app** (`com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo`) and **Spotify** (`com.spotify.client.PlaybackStateChanged`). This means **browser audio (YouTube, web players), podcast apps, and any other source that doesn't post to DNC will not be detected** — we're tracking the issue and will switch back to a system-wide source the moment one is available. PRs with cleaner workarounds welcome.
